## Goal

Track improvements to the repo-native planning, ticket, and legacy scratchboard workflow.

## Child Ticket Order

This table is the execution order; dependency eligibility still controls when each ticket can be claimed.

| Ticket | Title | Status | Depends on |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `RWF-005` | Add the anima project-management skill | `backlog` | none |
| `RWF-001` | Rebuild the canonical ticket initiative index | `backlog` | none |
| `RWF-002` | Mark scratchboard legacy and add migration checklist | `backlog` | `RWF-001` |
| `RWF-003` | Add ticket metadata validation | `backlog` | `RWF-001` |
| `RWF-004` | Reconcile repository documentation and hygiene | `backlog` | none |
| `RWF-006` | Validate, publish, and complete PR review | `backlog` | `RWF-001`, `RWF-002`, `RWF-003`, `RWF-004`, `RWF-005` |

## Deliverables

- Canonical ticket initiative index and scratchboard legacy/migration path
- Read-only repository organization validation
- Current repository documentation, audit, and tracked-log hygiene
- Repo-owned anima project-management skill and repository workflow integration
- Final local validation, authorized draft PR publication, current-head review, and metadata closeout

## Acceptance

- Every child ticket references this parent
- Parent status table reflects child progress
- Completed child tickets are listed below with timestamps
- All six required child tickets satisfy their acceptance criteria
- `RWF-006` and this parent close only after the implementation head has a clean current-head review
- The closeout metadata commit is pushed and a fresh exact `@codex review` request is posted

## Post-closeout Terminal Guard

- Review the final closeout head under the same current-head stopping rule without merging automatically.
- If actionable feedback invalidates acceptance, reopen the affected child, `RWF-006`, and this parent consistently, then fix, close, push, and review again.

## Completed Tickets
