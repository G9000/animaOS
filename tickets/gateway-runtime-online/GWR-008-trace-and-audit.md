## Goal

Make every request observable from gateway ingress through runtime execution and persistence.

## Deliverables

- Shared `trace_id` propagation
- Audit log fields for auth, device, and request outcomes
- Correlation between gateway and runtime logs

## Acceptance

- A single request can be traced across both layers
- Security-relevant auth events are logged
- Trace IDs are present in failed and successful flows
